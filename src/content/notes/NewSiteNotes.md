# ENTITIES:
CORE:
- This exists on a spectrum of Singular to Whole.
  - Singular: Lisa, Kevin, etc
  - Group of n: {Lisa, Kevin, Angelina}, {Lisa, Kevin}, {Brad, Lisa, Angelina}, etc
  - Whole: Society


# VALUE:
TODO: Take notes from the presentation you made.

### CORE: 

Objective Value: (pyramid) aka OV
- Has lots of dimensions to what it is:
  - Overall value unit.
  - The relationships between each Product.
  - How many of each Product "you" own.
  - Total value units for each product.

### VALUE + ENTITIES:

Subjective Value: (pyramid 2) aka SV
- Subjective is created from an entities approximation of OV. This is a value function. V(x) = ?
  - This will obviously have an error. SV and OV could theoretically be the same but in the real world never. 
  - 

VALUE WITH TIME:
OV:
- Creative destruction is adding a new P that does something an old P did but better.
  - New P has more value than old P did when new P didn't exist.
  - Old P loses value when new P is created.
  - Thus when creative destruction occurs OV increases, old Ps lose value, and new Ps gain value.
















MONEY: 

- We can create a universal numeraire for each product. 
  - This is Money
  - Money is a representation of Value. 
    - Society views it as an abstract form of Value. 
    - This allows for barter to succeed. 
    - No longer need the double coicidence of wants as both parties will always want abstract value. 
  - Money will always perfectly represent subjective value, but, in the real world, will never perfectly represent objective value.
