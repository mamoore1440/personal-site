Fundamentals:
- Value
- Yield
- Risk
- Temporality
- Invisible Hand
  - This is a way of approximating objective value and risk based on an aggregation of what society thinks. This is obviously flawed as society is biased in lots of ways. 
- Cycles
- Money and Debt

Models:
- Suppy and Demand (Markets)
  - Bond Market
  - Money Market
- Yield Curve
  - YCC

Assets + Markets:
- UST

### First NEED to learn:

1. Yield
  - That it can be found anywhere
  - That yield can be positive and negative
  - Yield is NOT a unit
2. Risk 
  - That it there is risk to everything
  - That the odds dont matter as they are mostly 0
  - The average risks are what matter
3. Value
  - Subjective
  - Value of an object is based on comparison with EVERYTHING else
  - Most common way to measure is compare the object with the dollar
4. Supply and Demand
  - What is supply
  - What is demand
  - What is equilibrium


### Then you learn what Assets and Markets are:

- A Assets:         All A Assets have R Risk
  - Equity
  - Housing
  - Money
    - The Dollar
    - Forex
    - Crypto
  - Debt Instruments
    - US Gov Bonds
      - You should talk about The Yield Curve here.
        - 2: Yield Curve Control and Yield Curve Inversion

    - Corporate Bonds
    - IDK
      - Securitized Loans
      - Credit Market Instruments
      - Fixed Income Assets

- R Risks:
  - Interest Rate Risk
  - Default Risk




- M Markets:          All M Markets have C Cyles
  - Equity                        "The Stock Market"
  - Housing                       "The Housing Market"
  - Money
    - The Dollar                  "The Money Market"
    - Forex                       "The Forex Market"
    - Crypto                      "The Crypto Market"
  - Debt Instruments:
    - You should talk about Credit Crises here

    - US Gov Bonds                "The Bond Market"
    - Corporate Bonds             "The Corporate Bond Market"
    - IDK                         "The Debt Market?"
      - Securitized Loans
      - Credit Market Instruments
      - Fixed Income Assets

- C Cycles: 
  - Business cycle 
    - > Forest analogy!
  - Debt cycles
    - 7
    - 100 
  - Bear & Bull Market Cycles


### Finally you need to learn that:
##### The Economy is the set of all Assets, Markets, and Participants under a unifying Philosopy

- E Economies:
  - Assets
  - Markets

  - Participants
    - Consumer; Domestic and Foreign
    - Producer; Domestic and Foreign

  - Philosophy
    - Government is included here
    - free, communism, socialism, mixes, bird in a cage, etc
