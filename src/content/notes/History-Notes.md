Each page/year/whatever shold have a *STORY ARC*
It would be ARCs stacked on top of each other that show the current strengths, weaknesses, and problems of the economy
 * WW2 until 70s have good economy (low problems)
 * 80s on have unproductive debt
 * 04 on has bad housing bubble
   * deflated a bit in 08, but worse now.
 * Revival attemps also

This is the history of the American economy. This would become the set and setting of our current event. 
Unfortunately, this looks like a lot of work.
