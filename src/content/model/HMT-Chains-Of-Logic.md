HUMANS, MATTER AND TIME CHAINS OF LOGIC:

Base Model components:
* Humans, Reality, Time, TFP

# Pre-Sin:
Assumptions: 
* Humans are always magnanimous: Demands are always made with the assumption of working towards a greater goal.

Humans are always magnanimous  
=> There will never be an occurance of Demand which prioritizes the percieved Utility of an individual over the percieved Utility of all of Humanity
    => There will never be a tragedy of the commons
        => Supply will always stay in the CC
    => Demand never needs to be rejected, only filtered
        => Ownership of Supply would be a detriment => Ownership of Supply would not exist
            => Supply will always stay in the CC => Supply never enters PP
            => The economy is running at peak possible efficiency && There is no need to trade ownership of Supply
                => There is no barter
                => Money would be a detriment => Money would not exist
            => Debt cannot exist
                => Temporality of demand can not be manipulated


Ownership of Supply would not exist => The Material "Hard-Line" problem would not exist

There will never be an occurance of Demand which prioritizes the percieved Utility of an individual over the percieved Utility of all of Humanity
    => Cohesion will never get entangled
        => Cohesion always stays at 100
            => The Spiritual "Hard-Line" problem would not exist


Temporality of demand can not be manipulated
&& Demand never needs to be rejected, only filtered
&& Ownership of Supply would not exist
    => There are no need for Economic, Financial, or Governmental Systems


# Post-Sin:
Assumptions:
* Humans are not always magnanimous

Humans are not always magnanimous
=> There will be occurances of Demand which prioritizes the percieved Utility of an individual over the percieved Utility of all of Humanity
    => There will be tragedy of the commons
        => At times certain Supply will have to leave the CC and enter PP
    => Demand does need to be rejected
        => Ownership of Supply is a benefit => Ownership of Supply will exist
            => At times certain Supply will have to leave the CC and enter PP
            => Highly efficient Demands will be rejected
                => Efficiency will drop
                    => Barter is needed to trade ownership of Supply => Increases efficiency
                    => Money exists to increase efficiency
                    => Debt exists to increase efficiency
                        => Temporality of Demand will be manipulated

Ownership of Supply will exist
=> A Humans Utility change moment to moment is dependant on what and how much Supply they own
    => Humans, by wanting to maximize Utility, will want to maximize Supply ownership
        => Humans will Value Supply Subjectively
            => Supply has Subjective Value
                => The Subjective Value of a Supply affects a Human's decision making process


Ownership of Supply does exist => The Material "Hard-Line" problem does exist

There will be occurances of Demand which prioritizes the percieved Utility of an individual over the percieved Utility of all of Humanity
    => Cohesion does get entangled
        => Cohesion drops to 0 at infinity
            => The Spiritual "Hard-Line" problem does exist

Temporality of demand will be manipulated
&& Demand needs to be rejected
&& Ownership of Supply exists
    => There is a need for Economic, Financial, and Governmental Systems





## SN: Chains Of Logic
This will be the last facist uprising. The only reason you have a fascist uprising is due to the 100-year cycles destroying a society. The 100-year cycle is only possible due to a fundamental misunderstanding in economics. The misunderstanding, or more accurately purposely hidden knowldege, allows for levers to be manipulated that are deemed to be invisible by leading institutions (fed, fed, academics, finance). This allows to attempted usurption of fundamental economic principles in an attempt to never have the 100-year bust.
Facist uprisings are also a great opportunity for Lucifer to push major changes. Because of this fact and this being the last facist uprising Lucifer will have to act during this cycle. We will be forced to enter revelations by Lucifer: simply because Lucifer pulls the most Humans down during the 100-year crash.

### God Should Own Your Spirit
God is good. && I have sinned while God has not.
=> I am not good.
&1 => (If I own my spirit => the owner of my spirit is not good.)
&1 => (If God owns my spirit => the owner of my spirit is good.) 


### Income
Proof: The existance of private property causes the existance of income. 
    Ownership of Supply changes over time => Individually held wealth changes.
Proof: Individually held wealth changes => Subjections change. Proof by definition.

### Cycles
Debt existing and Humans being imperfect at investing => 7-year debt cycle exists
7-year debt cycle 
&& central banks existing 
&& fundamental lack of understanding in economics 
    => 100-year debt cycle exists
