# Part 1: Basics Of The Model
## Assumptions: 
* Humans
  * Humans have Subjections of Reality
  * Humans are inventive
  * Humans are imperfect at viewing Reality
  * Humans have free-will
  * Humans interact with Reality based on their Subjections
  * Humans are self aware about their existance (They know the assumption and they know they move forward in Time)
* Reality
  * Reality does not have free-will
  * Reality changes over Time
* Time
  * Time always moves forward
* S&D Field
  * Humans and Reality interact with each other over the S&D Field
* The Model In General
  * The base measurements for Humans, Reality, and Time are the smallest possible measurements

## Proofs
### Humans
Humans have Subjections of Reality && Reality changes over Time
  => Human Subjections change over Time (1)

Humans have free-will 
  => Changes in Humans are nondeterministic
    => The future state of Humans is essentially impossible to determine (2)

Humans are imperfect at viewing Reality && Humans have Subjections of Reality
  => Subjections of Reality will essentially never be perfect (3)

### Reality
Reality does not have free-will && Reality changes over Time
  => Any changes in Reality that originate from Reality are deterministic
    => The future of Reality can be calculated if there are no Humans (4)

Humans have free-will && Reality changes over Time && Humans and Reality interact with each other over the S&D Field
  => Any changes in Reality that originate from Humans are nondeterministic
    => The future of Reality can not be calculated if there are Humans (5)

### Time
Time always moves forward
  => Time can not move backwards

### The Model In General
Humans are inventive 
  => Humans will discover and invent over Time 
    => TFP will exist and improve over Time (6)

The base measurements for Humans, Reality, and Time are the smallest possible measurements && Changes in Humans and Reality occur one at a time over these smallest measurements
  => These smallest changes can be combined together to form an aggregate change without losing information (This is integration in calculus)
    => Humans, Reality, and Time can be viewed at any scale with losing information (7)

Subjections of Reality will essentially never be perfect (3) && Humans interact with Reality based on their Subjections
  => The perfectly efficient S&D Connections will essentially never take place
    => Pareto efficiency is essentially impossible (8)

## What We Have Proven:
* Humans
  1. Human Subjections change over Time
  2. The future state of Humans is essentially impossible to determine
  3. Subjections of Reality will essentially never be perfect
* Reality
  4. The future of Reality can be calculated if there are no Humans
  5. The future of Reality can not be calculated if there are Humans
* Time
  6. Time can not move backwards
* The Model In General
  7. TFP will exist and improve over Time
  8. Humans, Reality, and Time can be viewed at any scale with losing information
  9. Pareto efficiency is essentially impossible

# Part 2: A Utopian World

Humans are always magnanimous  
=> There will never be an occurance of Demand which prioritizes the percieved Utility of an individual over the percieved Utility of all of Humanity
    => There will never be a tragedy of the commons
        => Supply will always stay in the CC
    => Demand never needs to be rejected, only filtered
        => Ownership of Supply would be a detriment => Ownership of Supply would not exist
            => Supply will always stay in the CC => Supply never enters PP
            => The economy is running at peak possible efficiency && There is no need to trade ownership of Supply
                => There is no barter
                => Money would be a detriment => Money would not exist
            => Debt cannot exist
                => Temporality of demand can not be manipulated


Ownership of Supply would not exist => The Material "Hard-Line" problem would not exist

There will never be an occurance of Demand which prioritizes the percieved Utility of an individual over the percieved Utility of all of Humanity
    => Cohesion will never get entangled
        => Cohesion always stays at 100
            => The Spiritual "Hard-Line" problem would not exist


Temporality of demand can not be manipulated
&& Demand never needs to be rejected, only filtered
&& Ownership of Supply would not exist
    => There are no need for Economic, Financial, or Governmental Systems

## Assumptions:
* Humans
  * People prioritize Humanity and specifically Humanities happiness
    * Humans are always magnanimous: Demands are always made with the assumption of working towards a greater goal.
  * This decision making process is for Utility in the present and Utility in the future.

## Proofs:
### Humans

### Reality

### Time

### The S&D Field
Humans are always magnanimous
  => There will never be an occurance of Demand which prioritizes the percieved Utility of an individual over the percieved Utility of all of Humanity (1)
