# Part 1: Basics Of The Model
## Reality
This is Reality.
* R(T) will return the state of Reality at Time T.
* Δ(R(T)) will return the next succession of the Reality matrix at Time T.
* R(T) = Δ(R(T-1)). This equation connects Reality in the present to Reality in the future.

## Time 
This is Time; Time always ticks forward.

## Humans
This is Humans
* Humans have Internal Utility
* H(T) will return the state of Humans at Time T.
* Δ(H(T)) will return the next succession of the Humans matrix at Time T.
* H(T) = Δ(H(T-1)). This equation connects Humans in the present to Humans in the future.


## Supply and Demand Field (S&D Field)
This is the field on which Humans and Reality interact. This is not physical like Humans and Reality: you can not point to Demand, Supply, or a Connection.
There are two parts to the field. One is Demands which originate from Humans and the second is Supply which originates from Reality.
Connections between Demand and Supply take place within a moment.

* F_D(T) will return the Demands on the field (*)
* F_S(T) will return the Supply on the field (*)

When a Supply and a Demand Connect on the Supply & Demand Field:
  * Internal Utility changes for all Humans.
  * Reality changes in a deterministic way based on the single Supply and Demand Connection


(*) Note: 
* F_D(T) and H(T) are the same function but with different prioritizations.
  * Like if you asked for a list of student and classes they take vs. list of classes and the student who take them.
    * All information returned from one function exists in the other.
  * F_D(T) prioritizes Demands
  * H(T) prioritizes Humans
* This is the same for F_S(T) and R(T).


# Part 2: The Utopian Application
## Value
This is an infinite database. You can give this a function which will return a result.
Parts required for the question you ask Value:
* Context
  * Humans if necessary
* Time
* Supply

If any context is missing then the result returned will assume you meant everything (every context, every Human, every Time, every Supply)
