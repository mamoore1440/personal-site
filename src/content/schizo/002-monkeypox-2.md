<!-- cases: https://ourworldindata.org/monkeypox Cases up 24% week over week-->

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21K global cases with a 24% jump in a week. First deaths in Europe and a declared emergency for New York City and San Francisco! $SIGA implodes ~25% on FDA guidance updates and India has a different strain than Europe?!?</p>

<!--more-->

This time it's not even clickbait. Europe has it's first death in Spain. San Francisco declares an emergency for monkeypox and less than 24 later so does New York City! India also reports it has a diferent variant than Europe as global cases are up 24% this week. And to top it all off a company I have been watching closely, $SIGA, has some intense action this week. Let's jump into it!

<br>

### European Developments:

As monkeypox spreads and remains in the spot light longer we will begin to see more information. Unfortunately, this week the infromation comes in the form of deaths. In this reuters [article](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/spain-confirms-first-monkeypox-related-death-country-reports-2022-07-29/?taid=62e457384e1fc80001e69000&utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter) you can see Spain annouces 2 deaths. Specifically the article says "In its latest report on Saturday, the Spanish Health Ministry said 4,298 cases had been confirmed in the country. Of the 3,750 patients on which it had information, 120 or 3.2% had been hospitalised, and two had died, it said without providing further details". Overall there are ~20,000 cases of monkeypox. This means that Spain has <b>25%</b> of all cases! It is important to also take note of the hospitalization rate. One of the reasons Covid was so disruptive is because it had a high hospitalization rate. You don't have to die to bog the system down: you only have to be dead weight. And you have to remember the symptoms of monkeypox even if your not in the hospital. Talked about last schizo sunday: 

One [article](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/monkeypox-patient-interview-lesions/) from CBS has an excerpt about how brutal the virus is "A few days later, he says he developed intense flu-like symptoms, but as those went away, he says, 'More and more lesions were appearing ... And by far the worst part was the pain. I mean, to the point that I had to be prescribed narcotic painkillers just to be able to go to sleep.'"

This is bad. I really hope this stops spreading. The healthcare sector barely survived Covid. I'm not sure how well it would fair with a far more painful virus. 


### American Developments:

On the American side we see two developments: emergencies called by San Francisco and New York City and colleges are starting to worry about on campus spread. Some quick blips from this Guardian [article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/28/san-francisco-monkeypox-state-of-emergency):

- The city has recorded 261 cases so far, out of about 4,600 across the US, according to the San Francisco department of public health.
- "San Francisco is an epicenter for the country. Thirty per cent of all cases in California are in San Francisco,” said the San Francisco health officer Susan Philip."
- More than a quarter of cases in the US – 1,341 – are in New York
- So far, San Francisco has received 8,200 doses of Jynneos, the best vaccine against monkeypox. But officials had initially requested 35,000 doses to cover the most vulnerable residents.

The messaging done by both cities so far has been about protecting the gay/bisexual community, but if this virus spreads by air to air or by touch then they are in a world of pain. Especially New York City which hold 25% of American cases. It's important to keep in mind this virus is NEW. You should not throw out every assumption when dealing or think about the virus, but you should throw out a lot! This is the first time in history that monkeypox has sustained spreading outside of endemic areas in Africa. But for now: Off to Texas! 

We can see universities already contemplating how to deal with monkeypox starting with Texas A&M. Link [here](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/07/29/texas-universities-monkeypox-preparation/) and quick blips here: 

- "Monkeypox is much harder to contract via casual conversation or in a classroom setting than COVID-19, and health experts say the risk of exposure to monkeypox is currently low. So far, the virus has mainly spread between men who have sex with men, though anyone can get the virus though close contact. While it is not a sexually transmitted infection, it most easily spreads through skin-to-skin contact and is often passed along during sexual activity."
- "The virus is not deadly and hospitalization is rare, but Fischer said it is an “unpleasant” and “painful” virus. State and national health experts believe the number of cases will continue to rise exponentially and will spread. The virus causes painful, pus-filled blisters and lesions on the skin, along with fever and swollen lymph nodes in the early stages of infection. It can last from a few days to a month."
  - Rebecca Fischer is an assistant professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Texas A&M University.

Again, important to note that it doesn't just spread through unprotected sex. It's confirmed that it can spread with just skin-to-skin contact. Colleges are also a great place to spread a virus far. Students come from all over the country to study then go home on breaks. We saw this with Covid and its part of the reasons colleges went online. Monkeypox cases are up 24% this week. Will we go online again as cases keep coming?


### International Developments:

Even with all this unsettling news India comes in with the worst: "A team of Indian scientists have found that the monkeypox virus strain circulating in the country is different from the strain that caused 'superspreader events' in Europe, leading to a global outbreak of the disease". Not something I wanted to see.

Blips from [article](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/monkeypox-strain-in-india-different-from-europe-says-icmr-niv-study-122072901209_1.html):
- "A team of Indian scientists have found that the monkeypox virus strain circulating in the country is different from the strain that caused 'superspreader events' in Europe, leading to a global outbreak of the disease.
- The team from Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV), Pune, conducted genetic sequencing of two monkeypox cases from Kerala.
- The data showed that the virus strain present in the country is A.2, that was recently imported to India from the Middle East. It was earlier present in Thailand and the US during the 2021 outbreak. However, the strain that caused superspreader events in Europe, was due to B.1."
- "We might be looking at a distinct cluster of human-human transmission and possibly unrecognised for years. The earliest sample in the cluster from the US is indeed from 2021 suggesting the virus has been in circulation for quite some time, and earlier than the European events," he added.

Now this is a variant from a 2021 outbreak in America which as far as I can tell involved only one person. In my opinion this is not something to freak out about as this looks like its just a coincident. However, if this variant keeps spreading in India then I would be EXTREMELY concerned. This is something I will watch and update in a future schizo sunday if this (Indian) situation gets worse. And by worse I literally mean India has >10 cases. Because if America could stop it a 1 case in 2021 then India should be able to stop the variant at 1 too: and if they can't then I would say it's game over for containment. As we saw with Covid immunity from one variant is not immunity from another. And it doesn't just have to be immunity; the brief natural resistance didn't always carry over.


### $SIGA:

Some background from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SIGA/profile?ltr=1): SIGA Technologies, Inc., a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company, focuses on the health security and infectious disease markets in the United States. Its lead product is TPOXX, an oral formulation antiviral drug for the treatment of human smallpox disease caused by variola virus. SIGA Technologies, Inc. has a strategic partnership with Cipla Therapeutics to deliver sustained innovation and access to antibacterial drugs primarily against biothreats. The company was incorporated in 1995 and is headquartered in New York, New York.

I've been watching SIGA for a bit and even "traded" it briefly. I made profit, however I did sell before the recent big run up. $SIGA ran up 50% in the span of about a week, but on Thursday or Friday(?) it dropeed 25% on the day. What happened? The FDA gives updates specifically about monkeypox saying that there is no current approved treatment for monkeypox. I don't have a link to a news article or to a tweet, but here is what a zerohedge tweet said: "FDA updates agency response to monkeypox outbreak". And on this news monkeypox plumments. Opening at 22 it plumments <b>33%</b> down to 15 and rallies back up to 17 ending a down 25% day. I'm glad I sold, although I wish I had some of that 50% rally :sad:.
