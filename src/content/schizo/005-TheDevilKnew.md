### DON'T BE FOOLED:

I believe we are about to have an economic crisis worse than 1929 or 2008 soon. I know this is not a widely held belief. I believe that the same issues involved with both crises are again coming due. The major issues included in both crises are low interest rates leading to extreme bubbles for the main assets. The mains assets are land, equity, and debt for most entities (households, firms, and governments). 2008's unique issues of falling demand, a reserve currency crisis, and declining demographics are again coming back; but worse. I believe there is another issue which has never happened before which I am going to called the "microbooms". This post will not be about the specific issues. You are free to disagree with me on whether or not the crises exist or about my understanding of MMT. I am also going to assume what is popularily know as the "New World Order" is real. I only believe it becuase of both the biblical implications of Israel being ressurected from the dead and our proximity to this economic hypercrash. Instead I would like to ponder a question. How could The Devil forgot MMT doesn't work?

At every point in history where the MMT expiremnt has been tried it failed. If the "New World Order" was even half decent at reading a history book they would be able to see that the MMT philosophy is doomed to fail because a very core flaw in logic. The philosophy is built upon the idea of create a utopia in the present at a ever increasing tax for the future. Society does this through debt, but because society has a utopia in the present the tax (debt) is irrelevant. We gained more value than we lost. This only works if every investment adds sizable value to the economy. In the real world this does not work. Instead of being able to pay off the debt with our new utopian production we are left with a ever indebted society and economy. This leads to the debt load costing more than can be produced leading to bankrupcy. Bankrupcy is the decades of tax from the future slamming into the economies overnight.

Why doesn't it work? Well society has a cerain level of friction. This is, in my opinion, could be explained by sin. The friction makes society on average lose more value than they gain on debt. This is because people take on debt for reasons that do not add to production. Buying unneeded new cars and houses along with cheap consumer goods has lead to a society with unbearable debt. There is also the education and housing system that incourage unpayble debt mostly for social engineering purposes. Again, if the investments added more value than were taxed the debt load would never increase past the point of unbearability. Sinful debt is a singularily untenable debt that stacks up into a substantial crash. These crashes have always occured and will always occur.

On top of assuming the "New World Order" is real I am going to assume that The Devil knows sophmore year college economics. My question for this extratemporal demon is how could you forget MMT doesn't work? You've seen every bubble come and go and I'm sure you know basic economics well enough to know why they fail. You've seen countless governments try MMT and have influenced countless failing economic policies.Which I'm sure you knew would happen. For these reasons I can't accept that The Devil forgot. He most certainly knew that the "New World Order" economics wouldn't work. Instead I believe his plan is to create this bomb. He wants you to be caught up and angry. Angry societies reveal all.

I believe that The Devil's final plan is to create this bomb in hopes of tearing down the "New World Order" and creating his final system. The Beast System. Once society understands the cost of this crash is everything they have left it will not be hard to create a grassroots revolution. He will flip from one system to another using one final crash. Beware of whats to come.
