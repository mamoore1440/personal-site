### TABLE OF CONTENTS:

##### GENESIS:

##### A UTOPIAN GAMBLE:

##### ISSUES BOTH 1929 AND 2008 HAD:
* low interest rates => extreme bubbles for the main assets:
  * land
  * equity
  * debt for:
    * households
    * firms
    * governments

##### ISSUES UNIQUE TO 2008:
* falling demand
* a reserve currency crisis
* declining demographics

##### THE "MICRO BOOMS":

##### THE FINAL QUESTION:


### GENISIS:

I believe we are about to have an economic crisis worse than 1929 or 2008 soon. I know this is not a widely held belief. I believe that the same issues involved with both crises are again coming due. The major issues included in both crises are low interest rates leading to extreme bubbles for the main assets. The mains assets are land, equity, and debt for most entities (households, firms, and governments). 2008's unique issues of falling demand, a reserve currency crisis, and declining demographics are again coming back; but worse. I believe there is issue which has never happened before which I am going to called the "microbooms". This post will not be about the isseues. If you disagree with me on whether or not the crises exist: you can be my guest. I am also going to assume what is popularily know as the "New World Order" is real. Again I will say, if you disagree be my guest. I only believe it becuase of both the biblical implications of Israel being ressurected from the dead and our proximity to this hypercrash. Instead I would to ponder a question. Why did they expect it to work this time?


### Issues Both 1929 and 2008 Had:





I will give a synopsis of each issue along with its correlations with 1929 and 2008. The synopsis for the issues will include a brief summary of intputs and outputs.

Order of the issues: 


### Low interest rates:

Low interest rates


for declinging demographics talk about how social security will fail.
falling demand is in relation to the 99% not being able to purchas anything. 
I believe that on top of these problems we now face a reserve currency crisis which would make the "cliff" even steeper.
