<!-- cases: https://ourworldindata.org/monkeypox Cases up 23% week over week: 28,735/23,256-->

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Declared an emergency by 3 states and the federal government, cities are running out of vaccines and thus employing make-shift and advised against vaccine protocols, doctors in Israel are calling to be vaccinated, and cases are up 23% WoW!</p>

<!--more-->

Let's get into it! First off let's look at the case numbers: Oh, a ~25% rise Week over Week again?? You shouldn't haveü•∞! Obviously the cases show no signs of stopping. On top of this the federal government and three states-California, Illinois, and New York-declared emergencies for monkeypox. This is on top of the declarations made by the cities of San Francisco and New York City! Side thought: If you live in say San Francisco does that mean you are living in three monkeypox emergency declarations right now? Anyways These cities are running out of vaccines and are starting to do 1 shot vaccinations programs instead of the two shot program you are suppose to do. This is actually "frowned upon" and is even briefly talked about in one of the articles. I won't link the article simply because I do not remember which one it was and I refuse to go back and re-read each of them. We also see a doctor get infected with monkeypox in Israel because of extremely brief exposure to the virus. 

From now until the future-because I am getting lazy/bored-I will just be posting snippets from news articles and then briefly posting commentary after. You can put 1 and 1 together (hopefully).

### American Developments:

Monkeypox is now declared an emergency by these entities: The Federal Government, California, Illinois, New York, San Francisco, and New York City. More entities have probably declared it an emergency, but these are the ones that matter. 

Snippets from an NPR [article](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/08/04/1115676160/white-house-declares-monkeypox-a-public-health-emergency)

- The White House today declared monkeypox a public health emergency.
- A public health emergency can trigger grant funding and open up more resources for various aspects of a federal response. It also allows the Secretary to enter into contracts for treatments and other necessary medical supplies and equipment, as well as support emergency hospital services, among other things. Public health emergencies last for 90 days but can be extended by the Secretary.
- The Administration says it has made more than one million doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine available to states and territories to order.
- Governors in California, New York and Illinois have already declared state of emergencies in response to the monkeypox outbreak. Some cities, including New York City and San Francisco, have also made their own emergency declarations.

And snippets from [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/01/california-declares-a-state-of-emergency-over-monkeypox-outbreak.html) here: 

- But health officials have repeatedly emphasized that anyone can catch monkeypox through physical contact with someone who has the rash that characterizes the disease or contaminated materials such as towels and bedsheets. The CDC last month confirmed the first two U.S. cases of children catching the virus, likely through transmission within their families.
- Monkeypox can also spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person has lesions in their mouth, but this requires prolonged face-to-face interaction, according to the CDC. Physical contact is the primary mode of transmission, health officials say.
- The Health and Human Services Department has delivered more than 330,000 doses of the monkeypox vaccine to state health departments since May. HHS made another 786,000 doses available to states and other jurisdictions on Friday. But some clinics administering the vaccines say they still have not received enough shots to meet the demand right now.

And snippets from [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/07/30/monkeypox-jynneos-vaccine-supply-united-states/) here:

- Federal officials this week touted the arrival of hundreds of thousands of additional monkeypox vaccine doses, heralding it as a milestone in the nation‚Äôs fight against the outbreak. What they left out: The United States is entering a critical three-month period where cases may continue to multiply, but no more vaccines are scheduled to arrive until October at the earliest.
- The Health and Human Services Department has delivered more than 330,000 doses of the monkeypox vaccine to state health departments since May. HHS made another 786,000 doses available to states and other jurisdictions on Friday. But some clinics administering the vaccines say they still have not received enough shots to meet the demand right now.
- ‚ÄúThere are not enough shots‚Äù to pursue a strategy of relying solely on Jynneos, said a federal official working on the monkeypox response, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment, warning of a possible ‚Äúvaccine cliff‚Äù in coming weeks.
- Should the outbreak spill over into other populations in coming weeks, and millions more Americans be encouraged to seek out vaccination, that shortfall would be even more pronounced. The first two cases were confirmed in children last week and in a pregnant woman this week. Prior outbreaks overseas have spread to children, women and other vulnerable groups.

So Biden declares an emergency-which is essentially indefinite-to move funds around and to grant power. Will he do anything with it? Not that I've seen so far. It's also curious to see the snippet about monkeypox spreading through respiratory dropletsüëÄ. Where have we seen that one before? 

### Israel:

From the [Time of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/medical-staff-call-to-be-vaccinated-against-monkeypox-after-doctor-infected/):

- Medical staff administering monkeypox tests at Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv have requested access to the vaccine against the virus from the Health Ministry, after a doctor was infected earlier in the week while handling a sample, Hebrew media reported on Thursday.
- The doctor was wearing full protective gear while testing patients and was likely exposed to the virus while removing his gloves according to an epidemiological investigation, the Kan public broadcaster reported.

Reread that last line again. Bruh and LMFAO. We are in for some fun with this one. To be honest I expect this to be a repeating trend. Also I don't expect America's healthcare sector the survive if this is actually bad.


### Not This Again:

[NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/article/monkeypox-virus-covid.html?name=styln-monkeypox&region=TOP_BANNER&block=storyline_menu_recirc&action=click&pgtype=Article&variant=show&is_new=false):

- It is possible that the virus has evolved to become more transmissible in this outbreak. Researchers who have sequenced the monkeypox virus from recent cases have noted several mutations, but it may take some time to understand the role of these changes. Still, many experts believe that monkeypox can be contained. ‚ÄúTransmission is really happening from close physical contact, skin-to-skin contact. So it‚Äôs quite different from Covid in that sense,‚Äù Dr. Van Kerkhove said.
- The virus can also spread by touching or sharing infected items like clothing and bedding, or by the respiratory droplets produced by sneezing or coughing, according to the W.H.O.
- That may sound eerily familiar because in the early days of the pandemic many experts said that the coronavirus also had little human-to-human transmission beyond respiratory droplets and contaminated surfaces. Later research showed that the coronavirus can spread through much smaller particles called aerosols with the ability to travel distances greater than six feet. But that doesn‚Äôt mean the same will turn out to be true for the monkeypox virus, said Luis Sigal, an expert in poxviruses at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.
- Other routes of monkeypox transmission include from mother to fetus via the placenta or during close contact during and after birth.

To be honest this did ease me a bit, however I think this should be taken extremely seriously. I expect cases to keep spreading.
