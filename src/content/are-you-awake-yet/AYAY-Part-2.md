# Introduction:
## Part One Recap
In part one we introduced the model. We created four components, had 10 assumptions, and proved 8 facts. We connected Humans with Reality; had Humans and Reality change over Time; and had Humans and Reality interact on the S&D Field. This isn't a model that we are able to run or are even come up with functions about. We can't give inputs and there are no outputs. In sum, the model represents the real world. We specifically created it this way so that any conclusion we come to about the model or the interactions between the parts are also conclusions about real life. This can be seen with our proven facts. For example we proved Human Subjections change over Time. This is a fact about the model and in turn a fact about real life. Most of the information we concluded in part one were simple facts. However, there were some very important facts: the three most important facts, in my opinion at least, where conclusions about the model in general. 

These three conclusions being: TFP will exist and improve over Time; Humans, Reality, and Time can be viewed at any scale with losing information; Pareto efficiency is essentially impossible. TFP will show up quite a lot moving forward, and very vital to be understood. Pareto efficiency being impossible is also important. No one individual can ever be fully efficient and thus no organization or economy can be fully efficient. The final, and most important, conclusion is that we view the model and reality at any scale without losing information. The scope of the context can be whatever we want. If we want a firetruck to be a supply then it can be. We don't have to consider every molecule or atom. We can simply say that the firetruck is supply. However, if we did want to view molecules or atoms as supply then we can. If a hypothetical involves a chemist who is dealing with individual molecules then it makes sense to use a molecule as supply. If a hypothetical involves a physicist who is trying to take a picture of an atom using an electron microscope then it makes sense to have the atom be supply. The scale, scope, or perspective (what word you want to use) can be whatever we want. This is the same idea behind calculus. Small changes can be combined together to form an aggregate without losing information. Even these conclusions are very important, however these conclusions are minute compared to the conclusions we will come to in this part and the next.

## The Problem Of Decision Making
The astute among you might have notice one problem about the model: there is no reason given for why Humans would interact with Reality. Why are Humans making Demands in the model? We know that Internal Utility is the emotional state of a Human and we know that the emotional state of every Human changes with each S&D Connection. So do Humans make decisions to prioritize their own Internal Utility? How about the Internal Utility of a king? The president? Maybe their local government? This is not something we have decided. And because we have not decided this we can not conclude any assumptions about Human decision making in regards the model. On top of this we face another problem. In the last part we very clearly choose assumptions so that they would be true in the real world also. Fortunately, the assumptions made were rather easy to make. Humans having Subjections of Reality is accepted by everyone. Reality not having free will and Reality changing over time are accepted by everyone. The assumption we did make that could be disagreed with was that Humans had free will, but even then it didn't really matter if it wasn't true. We will only use that assumption very late. From that assumption we proved that the state of Humans is impossible to know in the future, and that the state of Reality is impossible to know in the future if there are Humans. These facts don't really matter and won't come up again for a long time. Decision making is not like this. It's very important and we need it now!

Decision making is very important both to the model and to real life. It's important we understand why Humans act. Why do we eat food? Why do we drink? Why do I go to sleep in a bed? I could just as well sleep on the floor. There's no reason I can't sleep standing up in the washing machine. Why do I sleep in a bed? Leaving the individual perspective and focusing on the sociological perspective is even more confusing. Why do governments exist? Why do jails exist? These questions all have to do with a Human's decision making. We have jails to put people in for when they commit crimes. But why is that action a crime? If it's bad why do people do it? As you can see these questions go on forever. Unfortunately we can not just ignore this never ending question. If we want to draw any more conclusions about the model, and thus real life, we need to model Humans decision making somehow. Whatever way we decide to model a Human's decision making process must be applicable to real life. Otherwise any conclusion we draw from the model will be worthless. If the model's Human decision making process is not applicable to real life then any conclusion we draw from the model will not be applicable to real life. This model is only useful if the conclusions are applicable. Thus we must be careful. This is thin ice.

We should ask a couple of questions about real life to start. 
1. Is there a single emotion people prioritize?
  * Does this prioritization always hold?
2. What's the subject people prioritize the most?
  * Does this prioritization always hold?
3. Is there a temporal aspect to decision making?
We have three main questions and two minor questions. Fortunately, the first questions is already answered by academic economics; unfortunately, the second the isn't. The third has a bit more nuance to it than the first two did.

Is there a single emotion people prioritize is quite obvious and academic economics vastly agrees here. People want to be happy; nothing more. Does it matter if people are just if they are not happy? Does a feeling of wisdom override happiness? Obviously not. What about accomplishment? No, that generally only matters because accomplishment leads to a form of joy. Happiness, joy, pleasure, Utility, etc is the most important emotion for just about everyone. The next question is easy to answer then. Yes, this prioritzation always holds. People want to be happy. They go to school because they can get more money so that they can be happier. They save for retirement so that they can enjoy life later on. People don't save for retirement so they can be mad or sad later on. Technically people could prioritize anger or even sadness. But I would make the argument that people are prioritizing these emotions simply because it gives they happiness. Sometimes people want to be angry or sad or even melancholy. Don't get me wrong, I love a good melancholy. But when I prioritize actions that lead to a melancholy I am only doing it because in the moment it is a pleasurable existance. This question was easy to answer. Happiness is the driving emotion for just about everyone regardless of how the happiness is achieved. 

Unfortunately the second question, the subject question, is a bit harder to answer and understand. Sometime people prioritize themselves, sometimes other, sometimes Humanity as a whole. So what should we do here? Should we have everyone prioritize themselves? Maybe have everyone prioritize Humanity when taking actions? Maybe have all actions be taken for the love of their life and if they don't know who that is they prioritize themselves? Quite obviously these all fail in comparison to the real world. The Human decision making process is rather hard to model. An assertion can be made however, and this assertion may possibly work. I assert that even when helping others, Humanity as a whole, their love of the their life, or even just themselves they do it out of a drive for personal Utility. When people pick up litter when they aren't required to they are obviously prioritizing Humanity as a whole, but in taking this action they are prioritizing themselves. They believe that this action is better for everyone and thus for themselves. An individual can only truly be happy and healthy when they are in a happy and healthy society. Thus actions taken by an individual to help society are on some level selfish. BUT just because the action is somewhat selfish doesn't mean the action is bad or shouldn't take place. Obviously people should pick up litter for two reasons. Number one, society will be happier and healthier; societal Utility would go up. Number two, that because society is happier and healthier then the Human will be happier and healthier; Human Utility would go up. If litter does get picked up by an individual does it matter which reason the they did it for? Quite obviously no. No matter what the Human's Utility would go up. In the end people people prioritize themselves. 

However, the example above has an inherient problem. In the example it's clear to see that people would pick up the litter because it improves society and thus the individual. However, we could just as well construct a hypothetical where helping society does not help the self. The individual and society will would be odds. In that instance who would the individual prioritize? Society or the self? Now I don't think we even have to construct a hypothetical here and walk through it because I think the answer is quite obvious. People will obviously prioritize themselves. Even if society truly is on the "good" and "correct" side-which would be antithetical to the real world in the vast majority of cases-there would still be a problem of the individual quite obviously being at odds with them. Society can't force an individual to act and thus the individual is free to act the way they want. Does that mean the individual is purposely choosing "evil" or the "incorrect" action? Not neccesarily. The individual could believe they are on the correct side even if society or the facts or the hypothetical are against them. A lot of times this has been the case in real life (MLK is a perfect example). They believe they are correct and thus they choose to oppose. The individual here is still prioritizing Utility because they believe that their side is the correct side. It's just in this case there is quite a lot of opposition. And even if the individual does know and believe what they are doing is wrong they are still doing the action simply because it gives them Utility by proxy of anger, revenge, exclusion, etc. At the end of the day people always prioritize themselves. The only question is how do they do so? Do they prioritize the whole and thus the individual or they prioritize the individual directly no matter the expense on the whole? Based on what we've talked about we can see that people prioritize based on their Subjections with the end goal of prioritizing their individual Utility.

To refresh the mind in regards to the third question: "Is there a temporal aspect to decision making?". This question isn't as difficult as the second question but is a bit more nuanced. Let's look at the facts to start. One, we know that Humans move forward. Two, we know that Humans know fact one. Three, we know that Humans make actions in the present. And four, we know that Time can not move backwards. Which means we can quite obviously come to the conclusion that Humans will prioritize actions in the present that prioritizes Utility in the present and in the future. To what degree this prioritization of Utility throughout Time takes place is irrelevant. We simply need to know that actions are taken in the present to prioritize an individuals Utility in the present and in the future. These actions are obviously based on subjections too. People may be wrong about their subjections in the future while not knowing they are wrong in the present. That doesn't matter though. They make actions in the present and thus make actions based on their subjections in the present. If they find out in the future that their subjections about the future were wrong then it sucks to be them. However, Time can not go backwards and thus they can not undo the actions they took that were based on the false subjections. In sum there is a temporal element but Humans are bound to it. Humans make decisions in the present based on Subjections about the future. However, in doing so they they are making decisions in the present based on Subjections that may be wrong. Humans are imperfect and thus the actions taken will not be perfect.

In sum, based on the questions and our logical deduction we can conclude a couple of facts.
1. Is there a single emotion people prioritize? Yes, Utility is always prioritized
  * Does this prioritization always hold? Yes, this prioritization always holds.
2. What's the subject people prioritize the most? People will always prioritize themselves; whether this prioritization be at the percieved expense of everyone else is irrelevant.
  * Does this prioritization always hold? Yes, People will make actions based on their own Subjections about what gains them Utility
3. Is there a temporal aspect to decision making? Yes, Humans make decisions in the present based on Subjections of the future. These Subjections may or may not come true.

Well, this is great but how does it relate to the model? Well we can make a couple of assumptions about the real world.

1. People prioritize themselves and specifically their happiness
2. This decision making process is for Utility in the present and Utility in the future.* 

* Niether Utility in the present nor Utility in the future is knowable because Subjections are imperfect. However this does not matter. People have to act and will thus act based on Subjections whether correct or not.

And this solves the conundrum we had earlier. If we make these two assumptions we now have model that gives us information about the real world. If we let the model loose with these two assumptions made we would see Humans and Reality update based on these two assumptions. Empires would be made and fall, People would find love and make families, Nationalism would rise, wars would happen, famine and plagues, but so to would hope, love, prosperity, and peace. We would see Humanity move through time and it's effects on reality. However going from what we learned about the model in part one to how the model operates based on these two assumptions is too much to handle. This is biting off way more than we can chew. Instead of jumping from part one to this we will instead go from part one to a utopia. Then when we understand the economics of the utopia we will explore the economics of the real world. In other words instead of biting off more than we can chew we will split the bite in two. First we need to understand economics with untrue assumptions that lead to utopias then we will explore economics with true assumptions that lead to our current standing. The utopia is easier to understand so we will start there. 

Instead of assuming "People prioritize themselves and specifically their happiness" we will assume "People prioritize Humanity and specifically Humanity's happiness". In the real world people always work for themselves. Whether they prioritize the whole to help the part or just directly the part is irrelevant. However in our utopian assumptions we assume they always work up. What we will see is that Humanity will always improve and there won't be any true conflict. The only conflict that will arise will be between finding what is true and what is false. Nevertheless let's add "People prioritize Humanity and specifically Humanity's happiness" to our assumptions and prove more in the logic.

## Value
We have another idea to address in this part: Value. Value is a tricky topic to cover and especially to mathematically define. In society at large Value is regularly considered only as far as market value is concerned. People rarely think about Value past the idea of what a market, or a singluar individual, will pay for something. But let's not look at market or personal value just yet. Let's consider a scenario when Value is easy to define. 

Say, for instance, we wanted to build a building and needed a singular support beam made up of a single Supply. The question of what has Value is rather easy to consider here as it just becomes a question of what material would work best to support the skyscraper. Here the obvious answer is to look at different metals and see which is better at supporting the building. For now let's ignore the obvious fact the steel is the correct answer here and instead look at different metals. Let's consider copper, zinc, gold, silver and steel. In this situation, because we only care about the metals use as a support, we only need to consider how much weight the metal can handle. In the case of the various metals we listed it would be easy to see that steel fills this role better than the others. Steel fulfills this role better than copper, zinc, gold or silver and thus steel-in this scenario-is more valuable than the other metals. Does this mean steel is the most valuable Supply in the world?

But if we consider a different scenario, say one about the ability for a Supply to remove hunger from an individual, steel would obviously fail. Steel is not good at being used for food unlike a hamburger or fries. A plain radish is better at fulfilling this role than steel does. Does this mean steel is a worthless Supply? We can see that the Value of a Supply is party due to the context in which we are evaluating the Supply. But there is another part; a temporal part. 

Let's consider a pencil and evaluate the Value of it. Right off the bat we can clearly see that the pencil has a low amount of Value. Generally it can only be used to write, but you could maybe find a use for it as a sort of mini spear. Maybe you want to stab an eraser for pleasure in which case the pencil would have some more Value. But overall the pencil is relatively worthless. However, what if I were to say that this pencil would save your life in a week? Would the Value of the pencil shoot up now? Would you hold onto the pencil as if your life depended on it? Clearly we can see that Time changes the enviornment and thus changes the context for which to evaluate each Supply. Just because a Supply has a little amount of Value in the presen doesn't mean the Supply will always have a little amount of Value. Just as how context affects a Value evaluation for a Supply so to does Time. 

Well this has become rather confusing. The Value of a Supply clearly relies on both the context and the evolution of the context. But, unfortunately, there is another problem. In the hypothetical we created to determine the Value of steel in a singular moment in Time we only determined that steel was the most Valuable Supply to fulfill the role. However we could also have used Gold or Silver or even Copper or Zinc. All these metals were a possible substitute for steel in regards to the context of a support beam. So clearly we can see that these metals still have Value and that steel is just the most Valuable of the considered Supplies. Which raises the obvious implication that the other metals could easily be used as substitutes for steel in the given context. Which means that each Supply now has a Value relation to all other Supplies in regard to the context. Technically, we could use hamburgers as the support beam it just wouldn't work very well. Technically, we could have used a whole volcano as a support beam; again this wouldn't be a very good idea, but it could still be done. For those of you saying that the hamburger solution or the volcano solution wouldn't actually fulfill the roles and thus they would have no Value are mistaken. We never defined in the context that the building had to be successfuly supported. In the given context every Supply could technically fulfill the role; just to varying degrees. 

Which confuses Value even more. Because now we understand that to successfully determine Value of a Supply we need to know the context, the ability of every Supply to fulfill the role considered in the context, and how every Supply fulfills every role of every other context throughout all moments in Time. In sum, to successfully determine the Value of a Supply, we need to know every Demand and every Supply throughout all of Time. Value is simply the knowledge of all of Humans and Reality throughout all time. This conclusion of Value is rather poignant and distressing. Obviously this is an unworkable definiton for anyone, but it is a true definition. We can not throw this out simply because it's hard to work with. We must add this to the components. Value is the knowledge of all Demand and all Supplies through out all Time. 

But just because this is a rather unworkable definiton from a Human perspective doesn't mean it is worthless. We can still (hypothetically) give a context and time to Value and have a list of Supplies and their respective Value be returned. This definition of Value works essentially as the perfect database. We ask it a question and it returns the perfect result. However, if we wanted to ask it a rather ambigous question, like what Value does cloth have, we would just be given an answer that has no use to us. Because we didn't define a Time or a section of Time we would get a result that includes all of Time. This answer would be unworkable for any Human. 

To conclude: Value is the knowledge of all Demand and all Supplies through out all Time. If we want to find the Value of a specific Supply we can ask Value for the answer. However the response would be unworkable as we didn't specify a context (Demand) or a Time. When we ask Value a question we need to specify the context, Time, (and if we want) Supply. Only then will the response from Value be workable. Obviously Humans do not have this infinite database and thus the definiton of Value is bleak. But we can somewhat solve this problem by defining a couple of definitions which are generally workable. Firstly, it's quite obvious that people really only care about Utility thus we can define a definition of Value as the ability of a Supply to give Utility. Secondly, for Time, we can split the definiton into a couple of Time periods. The Times we care about are: in the moment, in a month, in two months, three months, half a year, a year, 5 years, 10 years, and 30 years. We will name these functions V_U0(), V_U1(), V_U2(), V_U3(), V_U6(), V_U12(), V_U60(), V_U120(), V_U360(). These are the times I think we should look at. If you think the time zone of 55.35433 years is the most important than you can create a function for that time zone. There is no end to how we want to define Value. Any defintion of the contect, Supply, or Time is valid in regards to the overall Value.

## Ownership Of Supply: CC Or PP?
Yet another idea to address: how does Supply ownership work? As we shall see in this part there is no need for ownership of Supply. People will not own cars, houses, lightbulbs, or even a phone. They will be able to Connect with these Supplies but they will not own them. In this part it would actualy be a detriment for Humanity to own Supply which we shall see later. But it doesn't matter that Humans will not own any Supply in this part we should still define it.

We can simply say that Supply exists in either the community chest (CC) or in private property (PP). Luckily this is a rather easy conclusion to come to in regards to the real world. Obviously in the real world Supply is either free for everyone or is owned by someone: Supply is in CC or PP. In other words a Supply will exist in the community chest or will be owned by someone. If the Supply is in the community chest then any Demand for that Supply can not be rejected. So, for example, air is in the community chest. No one can stop you from breathing; that is something you can essentially endlessly Demand. On the other hand it is easy to see how PP works. Diamonds are usually in private property-I've never seen diamonds be in the community chest-this would mean someone owns those diamonds. If someone owns a Supply that means they can reject Demand for that Supply. This is done with Demand Filters which we will not get into now. For now all we have to know is that Supply can either exist in the community chest or in private property. If Supply exists in the community chest then no one reject Demand. If Supply exists in private property then owner can reject Demand.

Luckily we don't actually have to define PP or CC mathematically in the model. We can just assume this information is held in the R(T). Technically we can be so broad with this that the information could actually even be held in the H(T). Stricly speaking it doesn't matter and to be quite frank I don't care. Again the lower level of this is only being fleshed out to quell the haters.

# Explanation:
## Components Of The Model
### Value
We've talked about Value quite a bit so far but we need to talk about it just a bit more. Again this is essentially just an infinite database. We can ask it whatever question we want and get the correct response. What is the most Valuable Supply to support house? What Supply will give me the most Utility in this given moment? The most Utility over 10 years? All these questions and more can be asked to Value. But there is one crucial caviat: we don't have this database; no one does. Instead Humans create their own Subjections of what they believe to be the answers to these questions. Sometimes these Subjections are built upon mathematical reasoning or logic in which case the answer would be spot on the truth. But the majority of the time this will not be the case. People's Subjections will be wrong; they can be close, but the majority of the time they will be wrong. 

As of right now, because we are pre-sin, the only Value an object truly has is the ability to give Utility. Because of this the only questions we can give to Value are questions about Utility. We choose various time frames which gave us the following functions V_U0(S), V_U1(S), V_U2(S), V_U3(S), V_U6(S), V_U12(S), V_U60(S), V_U120(S), V_U360(S). If we call V_U120(S) we will get the total Utility of the Supply (S) in 120 months or 10 years. If we call V_U2(S) we will get the total Utility of the Supply S in 2 months. These functions are the most useful functions for us as of right now. When we are post-sin there will be a couple more functions that are more useful but as of right now really only Utility matters.

There is some nuance to Value that needs to be talked about. There is one more question in regards to Value that is useful. This question is the question of what is the current level of Utility that can be enjoyed by all of Humanity in a given time frame. For instance maybe we can enjoy 100k Utility in a year and only 10k Utility the next year. Maybe we only have 50k this year but 100k next year. Maybe it's 1m this decade and 100m the next. We need a way of seeing how much Utility Humanity will gain (or lose) in a given time frame. We can create a couple more functions to do this. These functions will essentially mirror the previous ones but will return the total Utility Humanity will gain over a period of time instead of focusing on the Utility of a single Supply. The functions will be V_TU0(), V_TU1(), V_TU2(), V_TU3(), V_TU6(), V_TU12(), V_TU60(), V_TU120(), V_TU360(). Note: the 'TU' in each function means "Total Utility" and that these functions do not take in a Supply.

The Utility functions are great functions for viewing Reality and specifically creating hypotheticals to better understand Value vs. Utility. Let's start by examining a couple of specific Supplies. Firstly let's look at bread. Bread has amazing Utility in the moment and great Utility for a bit. But after about a week the Utility that can be gained from bread wears out. The bread will get old and moldy and will actually be more harm than good if eaten. So there is an obvious decay in the Utility of the bread. This decay exists for just about every Supply. Factories, skyscrapers, phones, computers all decay. Sometimes the decay is fast, sometimes it is slow. But there is always a decay. 

The other way we can use the Utility functions is to see how Value changes with each S&D Connection. For example let's look at the bread again but this time let's assume that the bread can last 15 years before it gets bad or moldy. This is a weird bread that lasts 15 years before we need to deal with it in any way. How does eating the bread change V_TU0(), V_TU1(), and V_TU360()? Well this question may seem easy to answer but it is not. We can say that obviously V_TU0() raises because the bread was eaten and thus Utility was gained. But how did V_TU1() and V_TU360() change? In the vast majority of cases V_TU1() and V_TU360() will shrink. If we eat the bread now then we can not eat the bread later. BUT if we do eat the bread and come up with some way of changing the world for the better than V_TU1() and V_TU360() actually rose! So for instance if the world was pre industrial revolution, we ate the bread, then had an idea for the steam engine then V_TU1() and V_TU360() would rise. But if for instance the world was pre industrial revolution, we ate the bread, then had an idea that bread was fun to eat then V_TU1() and V_TU360() would shrink. Some of time when the bread is eaten long term Total Value will RISE, but the vast majority of the time long term Total Value will shrink.

From these two can conclude a couple of things. Just to recap the two facts are that there is a decay and that some S&D Connections will favor short term Utility over long term Total Value. The first conclusion is that trading long term Total Value for short term Utility is not strictly a bad idea because all Supply has a decay. If the Supply is going to decay into giving no Utility it is better to Connect with it now (in whatever way that may be) because then Utility will be maximized. The other conclusion is that any Supply with a high decay has very low Value later on in Time. So for instance (and this where the hot takes will start) the suburban housing that plagues America actually loses long term Total Value for America. These houses require lots of upkeep because they are so poorly made. This is why you see people talk about housing actually being a liability and not an asset. Each of these shotty houses made is a trade between Value lost in the future and Utility gained now. This trade obviously can't go on forever, but we will get in to this later: just not now.

Overall we can conclude two things:
1. All Supply has a Utility decay
2. Some Supply when Connected with by Demand will on average lower long term Total Value in favor of Utility in the moment

## Logic
### Assumptions:
* Humans
  * People prioritize Humanity and specifically maximizing Humanities Utility
    * Humans are always magnanimous: Demands are always made with the assumption of working towards a greater goal
  * This decision making process is for Utility in the present and Utility in the future
* The S&D Field
  * Economic efficiency and average Utility gained per moment is strongly positively correlated
* The Model In General
  * A higher TFP allows for S&D Connections with a higher magnitude

1. Humans are always magnanimous
This assumption is obviously false. We are only making this assumption because it's easier to jump from part one to this than to part three immediatally.

2. This decision making process is for Utility in the present and Utility in the future
This is a cold take about reality. Everyone makes decisions that are based both on the present and the future. For example people save for retirement in the present because they expect to benefit from the savings in the future. 

3. Economic efficiency and average Utility gained per moment is strongly positively correlated
This is a cold take too. A more efficient economy raises the average Utility gained per moment. This is because it allows people to have more leisure and work less.

4. A higher TFP allows for S&D Connections with a higher magnitude
This is a cold take too. As tech increases you can have more technology. When gunpowder gets invented you would be able to mine better but you could also make a cannon. When atomic technology is discover you could make a nuclear reactor as well as a nuclear bomb.


### Proofs:
Because the proofs are getting abit more complex and jump around quite a bit I am going to have to go through them one at a time. Which means we will jump from The S&D Field to Reality to Humans to The S&D Field etc. I will put what section I would associate them with but the categorization of each proof is irrelevant: it's just a way for me and you to better understand how everything fits together.

Humans are always magnanimous
  => There will never be an occurance of Demand which prioritizes the percieved Utility of an individual over the percieved Utility of all of Humanity (1)

(The S&D Field) Here we are making a rather important step in the model. Essentially all this is saying is that if people are always working up then they can never work down. If every Demand created by Humans is Demand that is the best for everyone then there is no Demand being created that is bad for everyone. No Demand for nuclear bombs, no Demand to mess with someones online profile, no Demand to slander or enrage someone, no Demand to break a car commonly used, no Demand to do herion or crack, no Demand to poison water. Every Demand is a positive Demand. 

There will never be an occurance of Demand which prioritizes the percieved Utility of an individual over the percieved Utility of all of Humanity (1)
  => There will never be a tragedy of the commons (2)

(The S&D Field) Quickly we are going to go down a quick chain then we are going to go back to (1). Here we are saying that because there is no occurance of Demands that prioritizes a part of Humanity over the whole then there has to be no occurance where a tragedy of the commons happens. In case you don't know a tragedy of the commons is when too much Demand causes a resource to go extinct or become unusable or become worthless. The most common example used is with fishing. If everyone fishes at the same spot then the pond or lake will go dry and there won't be any fish left. A tragedy of the commons will take place. But if Demands made only help everyone then this can not take place. No one would fish the lake or pond dry. Technically this could happen on accident but it would be extremely unlikely, and when a tragedy of the commons did take place accidentally it would be minute. Major tragedies of the commons like running out of industrial use sand would be rather hard for Humanity to do accidentally.

There will never be a tragedy of the commons (2)
  => Supply will always stay in the CC (3)

(Reality) If there is never a tragedy of the commons then there is never a need for Supply to leave the community chest. Essentially all Supply will stay usable by everyone. There will not be private property. All cars, all buildings, all food, all water, all electronics, all electricity would be in the community chest. No ones Demand would ever by denied. There wouldn't be a reason to deny Demand because every Demand would help Humanity in a positive way.

There will never be an occurance of Demand which prioritizes the percieved Utility of an individual over the percieved Utility of all of Humanity (1)
  => Demand never needs to be rejected, only filtered (4)

(The S&D Field) Here we are back to (1) and are going to prove that Demand never needs to be rejected, only filtered. We have touched upon this idea in (2) and (3) but never fully used it. The proof is rather simple: if every Demand is working towards helping Humanity then there is no need for any one persons Demand to be rejected. However there is a caviat. If there is too much Demand and not enough Supply then some Demand does need to be filtered. For instance if five people want to eat 4 hotdogs then someone can't eat a hotdog. But no ones Demand will be rejected. Between the five people they will decide who can eat the one hotdog. And because Humans are magnanimous and never create selfish Demands then the individual who wants the hotdog the least will step out. Their Demand will be filtered. It's important to understand this is Demand filtering itself. No one got denied their Demand; someone just bowed out. When Humans are magnanimous there is no need to deny Demand. Demand will filter itself. This is foundational for a lot of part 2 and should be thoroughly understood. 

Demand never needs to be rejected, only filtered (4)
  => Ownership of Supply would be a detriment (5)

(Reality) Because we know that no Demand ever needs to be Rejected we now know that there is no need for ownership of Supply. This is essentially the same proof as (3). Because no Demand needs to be rejected we now know that all Supply can stay in CC. If Humanity did want to add ownership of Supply I.E. Humans start owning parts of Reality then everyone would have to ask to Demand the Demanded Supply. But because people know that every Demand is a positive Demand then there would be no reason to reject Demand which means the ask to Demand would always be accepted. There wouldn't be an instance where Demand should be rejected. Thus ownership of Supply would be a detriment. People would waste Time and thus Utility by having to ask to Connect and also giving permission. 

Ownership of Supply would be a detriment (5) 
&& Economic efficiency and average Utility gained per moment is strongly positively correlated
&& People prioritize Humanity and specifically maximizing Humanities Utility
  => Ownership of Supply would not exist (6)

(The Model In General) Because we know ownership of Supply would be a detriment and that the more efficient an economy is the more Utility Humanity gains we also know that ownership of Supply would not exist. People want to maximize Utility and no one wants to drag down economic efficiency. Not even a little. We know that ownership of Supply causes a loss in efficiency and thus we know it causes a loss in Utility. People don't want this and thus ownership of Supply would not exist.

Ownership of Supply would not exist (6)
  => Supply will always stay in the CC (7) => Supply never enters PP (7)

(Reality) This is a simple proof. Because ownership of Supply would no exist we know that Supply will always stay in the CC. Because Supply always stays in the CC and because we know that Supply can either exist in CC or PP that Supply will never enter PP.

Demand never needs to be rejected, only filtered (4)
  => The economy is running at peak possible efficiency (8)

(The S&D Field) This proof is extremely important and the proven idea will come up later but flipped around when we enter part 3. Initially we know one fact: That Demand never needs to be rejected, only filtered. From here we can conclude that if someone does want to Connect with Supply that they will do so. There will never be an occurance where a Human wants to Connect with an available Supply but is rejected. If someone wants to eat bread they will eat the bread. If someone wants to drive a truck they will drive a truck. There will never be a case where someone wants to do something but will be denied. Again there is an issue of shortages at times but that is not a sizable problem. People who would profit the least in regards to Utility would filter themselves out. So because we know that Demand is never rejected we know that in every moment of Time each S&D Connection that takes place is the S&D Connection that is the most efficient. There is never a case where someone is forced to do an S&D Connection that is sub optimal. Because of this we know that in each moment The economy is running at peak possible efficiency. I say peak possible simply because people are not perfect. The Subjections Humans have will never be perfect and thus the economy will never be perfect.

Ownership of Supply would not exist (6)
  => There is no need to trade ownership of Supply (9)

(Humans) This is a rather simple one. Because we know that no one will own any Supply we then know that there is no need to trade Supply. If no one owns chickens or cows or goats then they can't trade the chickens or cows or goats. Everything is in the community chest and will stay there. 

There is no need to trade ownership of Supply (9)
  => There will be no barter (10)

(Humans) This goes hand in hand with (9). Because there is no trade of ownership of Supply there could not possibly be any barter. 

There is no need to trade ownership of Supply (9)
  => Money would be a detriment (11) 

(The S&D Field) Here the argument is that money has to be a detriment because it would be to facilitate S&D Connections that were already going to take place. If you could walk into a supermarket adn grab a water bottle then why would you want to walk into a supermarket, grab a water bottle, then pay? The payment would simply be a waste of everyones time and thus money would be a detriment. 

Money would be a detriment (11) 
&& Economic efficiency and average Utility gained per moment is strongly positively correlated
&& People prioritize Humanity and specifically maximizing Humanities Utility
  => Money would not exist (12)

(The Model In General) This is just about the same argument as (6). People want to maximize Utility and they do that by maximizing the economy. If money is a detriment to the economy then it is a detriment to Utility. Humanity doesn't want a detriment to Utility and thus money would not exist.

Ownership of Supply would not exist (6)
  => Debt can not exist (13)

(The Model In General) Here the argument is rather simple but may seem complicated as we have not talked about or defined Debt yet. We will go over this quickly as it is a quick proof but some of you may be confused until you see part 3. For now this is a proof by definiton. Debt can not possibly exist yet as ownership of Supply does not exist yet. Ownership of Supply is required for Debt to exist: You can not possibly have Debt without ownership of Supply. 

Debt can not exist (13) || The economy is running at peak possible efficiency (8)
  => Temporality of Demand can not be manipulated (14)

(The Model In General) This is a proof that you will not understand yet because we have not defined what Debt is yet. For now all you need to know is that Debt pulls S&D COnnections forwards in time. It does this by allowing Demands to take place in the present that would otherwise not be able to take place. For instance if you wanted to plant seeds but didn't have seeds then the S&D Connection would not be able to take place. But if you got a loan then the S&D Connection could take place. In other words you can pull an S&D Connection forward in time. Before you were rejected but now you are accepted at a price. But because Debt does not exist then the temporality of Demand can not be manipulated.

Ownership of Supply would not exist (6) 
  => The Material "Hard-Line" problem would not exist (15)

(Humans) This is again another proof that would will not understand which is okay. Because there is no ownership of Supply the question of who should own what can not even be asked. Because this question can not even be asked the Material "Hard-Line" problem could not possibly exist. 

There will never be an occurance of Demand which prioritizes the percieved Utility of an individual over the percieved Utility of all of Humanity (1)
  => Cohesion will never get entangled
    => Cohesion always stays at 100
      => The Spiritual "Hard-Line" problem would not exist (16)

(Humans) This is an even more confusing proof for you guys but I would still like to cover it. Essentially because there is no Demand that prioritizes the individual over the whole then there will never be a case where an S&D Connection lowers the overall happiness. Everyone in Humanity will be perfectly happy with each other throughout all Time. Because of this there is no Spiritual "Hard-Line" problem. Again you don't have to understand this yet.

Temporality of Demand can not be manipulated (14)
&& Demand never needs to be rejected, only filtered (4)
&& Ownership of Supply would not exist (6)
  => There are no need for Economic, Financial, or Governmental Systems (17)

(The Model In General) This is something you will not understand which is fine. Essentailly because Debt can not be created, Demand does not need to be rejected, and because ownership of Supply would not exist that there wouldn't even be a need for any type of System. Humanity would live in anarchy and it would work. Obviously this isn't the real world but we knew that most of the assumptions and facts proven in this part wouldn't be applicable to the real world.

A higher TFP allows for S&D Connections with a higher magnitude && TFP will exist and improve over Time
  => Eventually S&D Connections with EXTREMELY HIGH magnitude will be able to Connect (18)

(The Model In General) The final proof is very interesting and extremely important. Because we know that TFP allows for S&D Connections with a bigger magnitude and that TFP will always increase we know that Eventually S&D Connections with EXTREMELY HIGH magnitude will be able to Connect. In other words that if Humans were truly free that they would eventually have the ability to decimate everyone and everything. This is already the case in the world and has been for some time. Humanity has had the ability to set of nukes and destroy the planet for a long time. It's important to think about this: Nuclear technology was technology that was invented 100 years ago.

# Concepts
## This Is A Utopia
Based on the assumptions we made and the proofs we did we can conclude that if Humanity did always work up we would live in a Utopia. There would be no locks and no password. There would be no private property and no governments. No war and no social classes. No taxes and no paperwork. No defined jobs and no defined work week. No insurance and no payroll. No money, no debt, no advertisements. When you try to connect to the internet there would be one access that wouldn't require a password. You wouldn't have to pay for groceries: you would walk in grab what you want and walk out. No one would lie as it would hurt society. It would be a utopia. A true utopia.

Why is this a Utopia? Simply because there is no Demand to be rejected. Demand will always filter itself which leads to the best S&D Connection taking place. Humanity would still progress just as we do in the real world. We would progress from the wheel to the cart; the enginge to the car; the chip to the computer. Humanity would still progress and it would actually be faster than how we progress right now. The S&D Connections that do take place in any moment or slice of time would be the S&D Connections that are percieved to be the best. 

## Value Trades
We talked about this at extent but it is very important to understand. Very rarely do action add Value to Humanity, and, again, by Value I mean Utility that can be had later in Time. The classic example is eating bread. Eating bread gives Utility in the short term but not in the long term. But with bread it makes sense to make this trade. The bread will decay away for Time because of mold so it should be consumed in the present. But with other Supply this argument does not exist. We brielfy touches on suburban housing but it is important you understand what is happening. The suburban housing that is built in America is not built for the long term: it is all a value sink. The houses require constant maintnance which means more Supply that could be used elsewhere. 

On the other hand there can be Value trades that are purely positive. For instance creating a chip factory is most likely going to be a huge positive for society. It will create Utility in the present and Utility in the future. It will allow for S&D Connections that are beneficial. The majority of the purely positive Value trades are S&D Connections that create or refine Supply that are used elsewhere. However if the S&D Connection is creating or refining Supply that wouldn't be Demanding (in other words be surplus) then it would be a Value trade between short and long term. These Supplies would be like water, electricity, computer chips, steel. Supply that can be used in just about any area of life. Researching technology and improving the efficiency of the economy are also purely positive S&D Connections. Researching and discovering the steam engine which allowed for the industrial revolution purely helped humanity, and it is at the echelon (with the computer, train, AI, etc) in regards to technologies that helped humanity

## Supply Splits
Because all of Supply is caught up in Reality and isn't parsed at all it is rather hard to see how Humans interact. This was by design when the model was being created, but it is still a good idea to try and split Supply up so that we can understand economics better. We will create two ways of looking at Supply, but you should understand that you can split Supply up any way you want. These are just the most common. The first split is Non-Excludable Vs. Excludable Supply and the second split is based on four categories of Supply. 

But firstly Non-Excludable Vs. Excludable Supply. This is a simple distinction: Non-Excludable Supplies are Supplies that everyone can Connect with while Excludable Supply is Supply that only one person can connect with. So for instance everyone can watch the same youtube video, but not everyone can eat the same tuna. The youtube video is a Non-Exludable Supply while the tuna quite clearly is excludable. 

The second split is about these categories: Land, natural resources, financial assets, and everything else. Now it's important to see that everything else is a rather broad category: both factories and sandwiches would be included here, but that doesn't actually matter. They can be combined into the same category and moving forward we will do so. It's also important to note that because we are making the utopian assumptions that finacial assets don't actually even exist yet. These would be stocks or bonds or whatever, but they have no reason to exist in a utopia. As with Money and Debt, they would be a detriment to Humanity and thus wouldn't exist. Land and natural resources are very important however. Land is finite and incredibly so; we can not create land. Natural resources also matter because this is the base Supply that Humanity interacts with. This is iron ore, whale oil, actual oil, water and fish in the ocean. These are finite but they are renewable; some more than others. We will talk about these four splits in Supply in various places later on.
