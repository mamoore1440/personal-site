# Introduction:
## Part Three Recap
In part three we changed one assumption: instead of assuming Humans were always magnanimous we assumed they prioritized themselves. Again, this doesn't mean they will always work only for themselves. Humans are selfless all the time, but in those moments we assume they are doing it to benefit for themselves. This small change in assumptions lead to drastic changes in how the economy operates. The primary change was the introduction of private property. No longer was all Supply in the CC; instead it now needed, at times, to move into PP. We also saw that as TFP increased more Supply would end up in PP simply because it would be profitable in regards to SV or just V to hoard that Supply.
